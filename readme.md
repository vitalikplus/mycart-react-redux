### The shopping cart on react-redux. 
This is the simple react-redux app for the shopping cart. There are 2 container: products and cart. The products can be added to the cart.  The quantity of the product can be incremented in the cart. Total cost of cart items and total for the cart are calculated on the fly. 

#### The possible improvements: 
1. Offline cart (saving the state in the localStorage)
2. Test coverage, inputs validation, error handlings 
3. Track how many product items are left on storage. Do not add the finished product. 
4. Use the components styled by material, bootstrap look.
5. Anything else?
